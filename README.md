  - We will utilize a Miro board for project planning/design as well as the built-in GitHub Project board to keep track of tasks and progress on the project.

  - For successful collaboration, we agreed upon using a new branch
  for each method and a PR for when the method is finished and ready to merge. The decision was made in our Slack huddle during the creation of the DTR.

  - Code design: Stat_tracker generates game, game_team, and team objects. Stat_tracker then stores those objects in arrays attributes and calls on them to return statistics from specific methods.
